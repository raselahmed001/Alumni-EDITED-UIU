			  <p>Alumni of a college generally stay in touch with their immediate friends but find it hard to stay connected with other college mates. Contact between alumni can be used to forge business connections and to gain references or insight in a new field. Alumni work can consist of alumni mentoring students, organizing alumni days, having training sessions during alumni days for alumni, inviting alumni to give lectures, arranging work practices, and proposing topics of theses, raise funds for the organizations. It is important to carry out a good follow-up marketing of alumni events.</p>
